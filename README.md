# Doodles

Doodles is a platform developed in React with TypeScript. It utilizes MongoDB as a database to store and manage user data, including profile information and created drawings. For image storage, the application integrates with Cloudinary, a cloud service specialized in hosting and managing image files.

Users can interact with the application using the mouse on computers or their finger on mobile devices to draw intuitively. The generation of images is performed using p5.js. In addition to the drawing functionality, the application includes a social component in the form of a drawing feed. Users can explore drawings created by others.
